* Estimates are considered unreliable. Starting with 2016 data, the reliability of survey percentage estimates is assessed using new multistep National Center for Health Statistics data presentation standards for proportions. Before 2016 data, the reliability of estimates was evaluated based on relative standard errors (RSEs). Data preceded by an asterisk have an RSE of 20%–30%. Data not shown have an RSE greater than 30%. For more information, see Sources and Definitions, Relative standard error (RSE); Statistical reliability of estimates.
- - - Data not available.
\1Includes all other races not shown separately and those with unknown health insurance status and unknown disability (functional limitation) status.
\2Estimates are for people aged 18 and over and are age adjusted to the year 2000 standard population using five age groups: 18–44 years, 45–54 years, 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and 75 years and over. Age-adjusted estimates in this table may differ from other age-adjusted estimates based on the same data and presented elsewhere if different age groups are used in the adjustment procedure. See Sources and Definitions, Age adjustment.
\3The race groups White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and 2 or more races include Persons of Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin. People of Hispanic origin may be of any race. Starting with 1999 data, race-specific estimates are tabulated according to the 1997 “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” and are not strictly comparable with estimates for earlier years. The five single- and multiple-race categories shown follow the 1997 standards. The race-specific estimates are for people who reported only one racial group; the category 2 or more races includes people who reported more than one racial group. Starting with 2003 data, race responses of other race and unspecified multiple race are treated as missing, and then race is imputed if these were the only race responses. Almost all people with a race response of other race are of Hispanic origin. See Sources and Definitions, Hispanic origin; Race.
\4Percent of poverty level is based on family income and family size and composition using U.S. Census Bureau poverty thresholds. Missing family income data are imputed for 1997 and beyond. See Sources and Definitions, Family income; Poverty.
\5Estimates for people aged 18–64 are age adjusted to the year 2000 standard population using three age groups: 18–44 years, 45–54 years, and 55–64 years. Age-adjusted estimates in this table may differ from other age-adjusted estimates based on the same data and presented elsewhere if different age groups are used in the adjustment procedure. See Sources and Definitions, Age adjustment.
\6Health insurance categories are mutually exclusive. People who reported both Medicaid and private coverage are classified as having private coverage. Starting with 1997 data, state-sponsored health plan coverage is included as Medicaid coverage. Starting with 1999 data, coverage by the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is included as Medicaid coverage. In addition to private and Medicaid, the insured category includes military plans, other government-sponsored health plans, and Medicare. People not covered by private insurance, Medicaid, CHIP, state-sponsored or other government-sponsored health plans (starting in 1997), Medicare, or military plans are considered to have no health insurance coverage. People with only Indian Health Service coverage are considered to have no health insurance coverage. See Sources and Definitions, Health insurance coverage.
\7Functional limitation is defined by the reported level of difficulty in six domains of functioning: seeing (even if wearing glasses), hearing (even if wearing hearing aids), mobility (walking or climbing stairs), communication (understanding or being understood by others), cognition (remembering or concentrating), and self-care (such as washing all over or dressing). Respondents with answers to one or more of the six questions are included in one of three mutually exclusive categories. Adults who respond “a lot of difficulty” or “cannot do at all/unable to do” to at least one question are classified in the “a lot of difficulty or cannot do at all” category. Of the remaining respondents, adults who respond “some difficulty” to at least one question are classified in the “some difficulty” category, and adults who respond “no difficulty” to all questions are classified in the “no difficulty” category. Adults who respond “don’t know” or “refused” to all six questions are excluded. During 2010–2019, 0%–8% of respondents were missing data and excluded. See Sources and Definitions, Functional limitation.
